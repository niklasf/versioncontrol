Version Control API -
An interface to version control systems whose functionality
is provided by pluggable back-end modules.


SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
This module is a work in progress, and not yet ready to use.
It's one of those modules being created within the Google Summer of Code 2007.
When it's done, the description might look approximately like this:

This is a pure API module, providing functions for interfacing with
version control systems (VCS). In order to work, Version Control API
needs at least one VCS backend module that provides the specific VCS's
functionality.

For the API documentation, have a look at the module file or run doxygen/phpdoc
on it to get a fancier version of the docs.

Some code in Version Control API was taken from the CVS integration
module on drupal.org, where the adapted sections were committed by:

Derek Wright ("dww", http://drupal.org/user/46549)
Karthik ("Zen", http://drupal.org/user/21209)

This module was originally created as part of Google Summer of Code 2007,
so Google also deserves some credits for making this possible.
